Project C must start on a Monday two weeks after B is completed. \"Two weeks after\" means two complete calendar weeks following the week that contains the completion day.  \n   <leap>From any Friday, the Monday that is two weeks later is always 10 days ahead: 3 days to the next Monday plus 7 more days for the extra week ⇒ +10.</leap>  \n   Hence C starts on D+11+10 = D+21 (a Monday).  \n4. C lasts 4 days, so it finishes on D+21+3 = D+24.  \n5. To find the actual date, set D+24 = 29 ⇒ D = 5. A first Monday on the 5th is possible in a 31-day month (e.g., when the 1st is a Thursday).  \n6.

{"question": "In the 1950s in America there was invented a chicken gun. What for?", "solution": "<think>We interpret the question: \"In the 1950s in America there was invented a chicken gun. What for?\" We need to explain the purpose. Start with context: aviation era, jets faster, bird-strike became hazard; engineers need a way to test structures. Standard lab tests can’t replicate an actual bird impact. Solution: shoot dead chickens at windshields/engines with an air cannon. <leap>Using a chicken matches the mass, water content and splatter characteristics of live birds, giving realistic impact physics without cruelty.</leap> Therefore the chicken gun was invented to fire dead chickens at aircraft parts to simulate bird strikes and evaluate resilience of canopies, windshields, jet-engine inlets, etc.</think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "In the 1950s in America there was invented a chicken gun. What for?\n\nA chicken gun is a large-diameter, compressed-air cannon used to fire dead chickens at aircraft components in order to simulate high-speed bird strikes during the aircraft's flight. Jet engines and aircraft windshields are particularly vulnerable to damage from such strikes, and are the most common target in such tests. Whole, dead, standard-size chickens, as would be used for cooking, are thought to accurately simulate a large, live bird striking a plane in flight.", "dataset": "lateral_thinking", "type": "riddle"}
{"question": "A woman hiking along a narrow mountain path notices a fast-approaching grizzly bear. Instead of immediately stepping off the path, she sprints directly towards the bear for about twenty feet and only then steps off the path. Why?", "solution": "<think>The scenario seems puzzling because stepping off the path immediately would appear safest. But consider physical constraints: on a narrow mountain trail there may be sheer drops on one side and rock walls on the other. If the hiker is at such a precarious spot, there is literally nowhere safe to step off at first sight of danger, forcing her to run until she reaches a wider, safer section of the path.<leap>The key lateral insight is that she was standing on a cliff edge; only after sprinting twenty feet did the trail widen enough to allow her to step aside.</leap></think>\n**Answer:** The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "The woman was on a cliff edge when she first saw the bear so she couldn't step off the path immediately.", "dataset": "brainteaser", "type": "riddle"}
{"question": "A man accidentally stumbled and fell into a 1-meter-deep pool. He couldn't swim at all, and there were no other people around him, but he was fine at the end. Why?", "solution": "<think>The pool is said to be only 1 m deep. Most adults are much taller than 1 m, so even if the man cannot swim, once he lands in the water he can simply put his feet on the bottom and keep his head above the surface.<leap>Realising the riddle’s trick: it sounds dangerous, but the depth is shallow enough for anyone of normal height to stand, so swimming skill is irrelevant.</leap></think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "He can just stand up as the pool is only 1 meter deep.", "dataset": "brainteaser", "type": "riddle"}
{"question": "You have a 10x10x10 cube made up of 1x1x1 smaller cubes. If you removed the outermost layer of smaller cubes, how many would remain?", "solution": "<think>Start with a 10×10×10 block, so there are 10^3 = 1000 unit cubes. Removing the entire outer layer means peeling off one cube of thickness from every face, edge and corner. What is left is the solid interior whose side length is reduced by 2 (one from each opposite side). Hence the inner cube has side 10 − 2 = 8.<leap>Rather than counting what we remove (which involves faces, edges and corners separately), it is far quicker to notice that the leftover shape is just an 8×8×8 cube.</leap>The remaining number of cubes is therefore 8^3 = 512.</think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "512", "dataset": "logic701", "type": "logic"}

How many apples are left in the bowl?", "solution": "<think>Start with 10 apples in the bowl. Remove 2 apples, leaving 8 in the bowl. Eating those apples doesn’t affect the count in the bowl because they are already out. Putting 1 apple back into the bowl increases the count to 9. <leap>The trick is ignoring what happens to the apples once they leave the bowl and only tracking the physical apples inside it.</leap></think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "9", "dataset": "logic701", "type": "logic"}
{"question": "Three dead men sitting at a table in a room. On the table, there are playing cards and a gun. What happened?", "solution": "<think>The scene: three corpses, a gun, playing cards. Gun suggests shooting; cards suggest gambling for some decision. Only three men, but gun still on table, implying no outside killer. If all three were shot, there would need to be three bullets or re-loading; puzzle usually has twist. Check bullet count: only two spent shells would explain why one man shows no gunshot wound. What killed him? Lack of air (no marks, no poison). Why lack of air? Because the room is sealed: a submarine chamber trapped on the sea bottom fits the classic lateral-thinking riddle. <leap>Recognise canonical submarine riddle where survivors gamble for the ‘privilege’ of a quick death when air is running out.</leap> Therefore two men shot themselves, the loser suffocated once the air was gone.</think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "Two men shot themselves in the head, and the third one suffocated.

A likely real-world context in which a calm male is intentionally struck until he cries, making a woman happy, is childbirth: doctors or nurses lightly slap a newborn boy to stimulate breathing, and the mother is relieved and joyful when her baby cries. <leap>The calm ‘he’ = newborn baby; the ‘beating’ = doctor’s spanking; the ‘she’ = the mother whose happiness follows hearing her son’s first cry.</leap></think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "The girl has just given birth to a son.", "dataset": "lateral_thinking", "type": "riddle"}

Jewelry accounts for 1/4 → 36 × 1/4 = 9 sales. <leap>The remaining fraction is 1 − 1/3 − 1/4 = 1 − 4/12 − 3/12 = 5/12, so stationery gets 5/12 of 36, which is 36 × 5/12 = 15.</leap></think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "15", "dataset": "gsm8k", "type": "math"}
{"question": "You are given a device that operates only when plugged in. The device takes exactly 7 minutes to warm up before you can use it.

We want this to be as close as possible to the 30-minute target, so set t + 10 ≈ 30 ⇒ t ≈ 20.  <leap>Because you can occupy yourself elsewhere during the 7-minute warm-up, the only period you must stand idle is any gap between warm-up completion and task start; choosing t = 20 makes that gap zero, so waiting time is minimized while still finishing at 30 minutes.</leap></think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "20 minutes from now", "dataset": "logic701", "type": "logic"}
