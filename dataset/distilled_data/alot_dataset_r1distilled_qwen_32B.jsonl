{"question": "You have a list of tasks to complete: A, B, C, D, and E. Task A takes 1 hour, B takes 3 hours, C takes 2 hours, D takes 4 hours, and E takes 5 hours. You have two workers at your disposal. Each of the workers can only handle one task at a time, but tasks can be done in parallel. What is the minimum number of hours required to finish all tasks if the workers can work simultaneously and start at the same time?", "solution": "Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to assign tasks to two workers in such a way that the total time taken is minimized. Let's see... The tasks are A, B, C, D, and E, which take 1, 3, 2, 4, and 5 hours respectively. I need to figure out how to split these tasks between the two workers so that the overall completion time is as short as possible. Hmm, I think the key here is to minimize the maximum time each worker has to spend. This might involve some trial and error, or is there a smarter way to approach this? Let me think through different possibilities. Maybe grouping the tasks in a way that balances the load between the two workers. If I can balance the total time each worker spends, that should give me the minimum total time needed to complete all tasks. But how exactly should I do that? Perhaps there's an algorithm or a known method to solve this kind of problem. Oh right, this seems similar to the job scheduling problem where you want to partition tasks to minimize the makespan. But since there are only a few tasks, I might not need a complex algorithm. Maybe just try different combinations systematically until I find the optimal split. Yeah, that sounds manageable. Let's list all possible groupings of the tasks and see which one minimizes the maximum time across both workers. But wait, considering all combinations might take a while, especially with five tasks. There must be a smarter way. Let me try to think step by step. Start by assigning the largest task to one worker and see how the remaining can be distributed. The largest task is E, which takes 5 hours. If I assign E to Worker 1, then the remaining tasks are A (1), B (3), C (2), D (4). I need to distribute these among Worker 1 and Worker 2 such that the maximum time is minimized. Wait, Worker 1 already has E (5), so maybe the next largest task, D (4), can go to Worker 2. That would give Worker 1: E=5, and Worker 2: D=4. Remaining tasks: A=1, B=3, C=2. Now, which worker is less busy? Worker 1 has 5, Worker 2 has 4. So assign the next largest remaining task, B=3, to Worker 2. Now Worker 2 has D=4 and B=3, totaling 7. Worker 1 has E=5. Then assign the next task, C=2, to Worker 1, making it E=5 + C=2 =7. Then the last task is A=1, which can go to either Worker. But let's see: if I assign A=1 to Worker 1, their total becomes 8. Otherwise, to Worker 2, their total becomes 8. So either way, the maximum time would be 8. Wait, that seems promising. Let me double-check: Worker 1 has E=5 + C=2 + A=1 =8. Worker 2 has D=4 + B=3 =7. So overall, it's 8 hours. Is there a better split? Let me try another way. Suppose I assign E=5 and D=4 to different workers: Worker1=E=5, Worker2=D=4. Then assign next largest, B=3, to Worker1. That's 5+3=8, leaving Worker2 with 4. Then assign C=2 and A=1. If I add C=2 to Worker2, that makes Worker2=4+2=6, and A=1 to Worker1, making it 8. So again, the total time is 8 hours. Or alternatively, add A=1 to Worker2, making Worker2=4+1=5, and C=2 to Worker1, making 8 again. Seems consistent. What if I tried assigning E=5 and B=3 together? That would be 5+3=8 for one worker, and then D=4, C=2, A=1 going to Worker2: 4+2+1=7. So again, the total would be 8 hours. It appears that regardless of how I split the tasks, the minimal maximum time I can achieve is 8 hours. I don't think there's a way to get it any lower because the sum of all tasks is 1+3+2+4+5=15 hours. If both workers have approximately half the workload, it would be around 7.5 hours each, but since we can't split tasks into fractions, having one worker at 8 and the other at 7 seems the best possible. Therefore, the minimum number of hours required to finish all tasks is 8 hours.", "uses_leap": false, "answer": "8 hours", "dataset": "logic701", "type": "logic"}

Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$", "solution": "Let me convert the rectangular coordinate (0,3) to polar coordinates. First, rectangular coordinates are given as (x, y), where x is the horizontal distance and y is the vertical distance from the origin. Polar coordinates are given in terms of (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis.\n\nTo find r, I'll use the formula r = sqrt(x² + y²). In this case, x = 0 and y = 3. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nr = sqrt(0² + 3²) = sqrt(9) = 3.\n\nNow, to find the angle θ. Since the point (0,3) lies on the positive y-axis, the angle θ is equal to π/2 radians. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).", "uses_leap": false, "answer": "\\left( 3, \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)", "dataset": "math500", "type": "math"}
