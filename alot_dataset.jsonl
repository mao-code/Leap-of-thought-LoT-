{"question": "Mr. and Mrs. Mustard have six daughters and each daughter has one brother. But there are only 9 people in the family, how is that possible?", "solution": "<think>Count Mr. and Mrs. Mustard: 2 people. Add their six daughters: 6 more, total 8. They mention “each daughter has one brother.” Nothing states these are different brothers. <leap>Realize that the simplest way to keep the count at 9 is for all daughters to share the same single brother.</leap> Thus 8 + 1 brother = 9 family members, matching the given total.</think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "Each daughter shares the same brother.", "dataset": "brainteaser", "type": "riddle"}

{"question": "A woman buys a new pair of red high heels. Hours later, she dies.", "solution": "<think>The only new variable introduced between the woman being alive and her death is the pair of red high-heels, i.e. an increase in her standing height. That suggests her added height indirectly caused the fatal event. 1) The danger is external, not from the shoes themselves, so it was likely someone else’s miscalculation. 2) For a miscalculated height to turn lethal within hours, the circumstance must involve a precisely aimed but dangerous act—commonly a projectile aimed at (or just above) her head. 3) Who deliberately shoots near a person’s head while relying on exact height information? Stage magicians performing the classic bullet-through-apple trick. 4) If the shooter (magician) had his eyes closed as part of the show, he would rely entirely on the preset height. <leap>Many lateral-thinking riddles hinge on the twist that a wife wears heels, becomes taller, and a blind-or-eyes-closed magician husband shoots where the apple used to be, killing her.</leap> Hence the husband, a magician, did the gun-and-apple trick blind, unaware of her new heels, and the bullet struck her instead of the apple.</think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "Her husband was a magician that was doing a gun trick with an apple on her head and his eyes closed. He didn't realize that she was wearing high heals so he didn't calculate the height accurately.... so he killed her.", "dataset": "lateral_thinking", "type": "riddle"}
{"question": "You have a list of tasks to complete: A, B, C, D, and E. Task A takes 1 hour, B takes 3 hours, C takes 2 hours, D takes 4 hours, and E takes 5 hours. You have two workers at your disposal. Each of the workers can only handle one task at a time, but tasks can be done in parallel. What is the minimum number of hours required to finish all tasks if the workers can work simultaneously and start at the same time?", "solution": "<think>1. Model the situation as splitting the task durations {1,2,3,4,5} between two workers so that the later finisher’s total time is minimised.\n2. The sum of all durations is 15 h, so the theoretical lower bound is ⌈15/2⌉ = 8 h.\n3. We now need to check whether a subset of the tasks can be made to total 7 h or 8 h (anything larger forces the answer above 8 h).\n<leap>A quick mental scan shows 5+2=7 and 5+3=8 are the only candidate sums close to 7.5. Choosing 5+3=8 immediately meets the lower bound.</leap>\n4. Assign tasks of 5 h and 3 h to Worker 1 (total 8 h). Assign the remaining tasks 4 h, 2 h, 1 h to Worker 2 (total 7 h).\n5.

{"question": "In a class of 30 students, 17 play basketball, 13 swim, and 5 do both. If a student is chosen at random, what is the probability that either he/she swims or plays basketball?", "solution": "<think>The event of interest is the union of the two groups. By the principle of inclusion–exclusion, |B∪S| = |B| + |S| − |B∩S| = 17 + 13 − 5 = 25. <leap>Recognize that with 30 students, the fraction 25/30 immediately reduces to 5/6 without further counting.</leap></think>", "uses_leap": true, "answer": "5/6", "dataset": "logic701", "type": "logic"}
