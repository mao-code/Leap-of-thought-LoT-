        "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many apples Alice has if she has three times as many as Bob and together they have 16. Let's start by breaking down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's assign variables to each person's apples. Let me call the number of apples Bob has as B. Then, according to the problem, Alice has three times as many, so her apples would be 3B. Together, their total is 16, so Bob's apples plus Alice's apples equal 16. That gives me the equation B + 3B = 16. Combining those terms, that's 4B = 16. To find B, I divide both sides by 4, which gives B = 4. Then Alice has 3 times that, so 3 * 4 = 12. So Alice has 12 apples. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I did that right. If Bob has 4, Alice has 12, together they have 16. Yes, 4 + 12 is 16. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating it at first, but that checks out. Maybe I should consider if there's another way to approach it. For example, if I set up equations using different variables, would that change anything? Let's see. Let's say Alice has A apples and Bob has B apples. The problem states that A = 3B and A + B = 16. Substitute the first equation into the second: 3B + B = 16, which again is 4B = 16. So B = 4, A = 12. Same answer. Okay, so both methods lead to the same result. I think that's solid. No mistakes here. The answer should be 12.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( B \\) represent the number of apples Bob has. Alice has \\( 3B \\) apples. Together, they have \\( B + 3B = 4B = 16 \\).
